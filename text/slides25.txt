== Foreign owned firms perform better than domestic firms ==
- US: Doms and Jensen (1998)
- UK: Griffith (1999)
- Hungary, Romania, Russia, Ukraine: Brown, Earle, Telegdy (2006)
- Indonesia: Arnold and Javorcik (2009)

== Managers matter ==
- Good management practices  increase  productivity  (Bloom  and  Van  Reenen  2010;  Bloom  et  al.  2012;  Bloom  et  al.  2014) and market access (Bloom et al. 2016). 
- CEOs behaving like ``leaders" gradually improve firm performance. (Bandiera, Hansen, Prat and Sadun 2018)
- Large increase  in  the  level  and  inequality  of  CEO  pay.  (Murphy  and  Zábojník  2004;  Gabaix  and  Landier  2008;  Tervio  2008; Frydman and Saks 2010)
- Managers have persistent effects across firms on investment policy, R\&D, advertising, return on assets.  (Bertrand and Schoar 2003)
- Sudden CEO death worsens firm performance. (Bennedsen, Pérez-González and Wolfenzon 2007) 
- Managers having past export experience increase likelihood of exporting (Mion and Opromolla 2014; Mion, Opromolla and Sforza 2016) and importing (Bisztray, Koren and Szeidl 2018).


== This paper ==
- Compile new, unique data on which firm is run by which manager: Hungary, 1980--2018. 
- Foreign owners improve firm performance by improving management.
- Research design: 
	- differences-in-differences comparing expat-managed firms to domestic managed firms before and after takeover
	- controlling for domestic change in management

== Contributions ==
1. Linked firm-CEO data for the universe of corporations.
2. Compare expat CEOs to local CEOs.

= Data =

== Data ==
=== Hungarian Manager Database ===
- coverage: universe of corporations, 1980--2018
- CEO: highest officer of corporation as specified in corporate law.
	- information: name, mother's name, address, tenure at firm
- 1 million firms, 2 million CEOs, 5 million job spells

=== Balance sheet data ===
- coverage: universe of double entry firms, 1980--2018
- information: sales, exports, employment, equipment, immaterials etc.

== Names ==
- We use manager names to infer 
	1. CEO change
	2. nationality
	3. gender (not used today)
- Foreign manager: firm representative with a non-Hungarian first name
	- e.g. Eva Bauer v Bauer Éva
	- but: George Soros v Soros György
- Allow for misspelling, omitted middle name, missing data (jr, dr)

== Sample ==
- Exclude: 
	- employing less than 20 people
	- financial sector
	- domestic firms with expat CEO
	- greenfield FDI
	- firms with more than 15 CEOs
- Left with 24,500 firms

== Variables ==
* '''foreign''': firm has majority foreign owner
* '''foreign\_hire''': firm has a manager hired by foreign owner
* '''has\_expat''': firm has an expat manager
* '''CONTROL${}^k$''': on of the three ($k=1,2,3$)
* '''lnL''': log employment
* '''lnQL''': log output per worker
* '''TFP\_cd''': TFP (simple Cobb--Douglas)
* '''exporter''': firm has positive exports
* '''RperK''': share of immaterial assets in total [0,1]


== Estimating equations ==
=== Bernard-Jensen ===
Sample: domestic firms and acquisitions
$$
Y_{ist} = \mu_{st} + \sum_{k=1}^3 \beta_k \text{CONTROL}_{it}^k + u_{ist}
$$

=== Selection ===
Sample: $\text{CONTROL}_{i}^{k-1} = 1$, years before acquisition
$$
\text{CONTROL}_{i}^k = \mu_{st} + \gamma X_{it}  + u_{ist}
$$

=== Diff-in-diff ===
Sample: domestic firms and acquisitions
$$
Y_{ist} = \alpha_i + \mu_{st} + \sum_{k=1}^3 \beta_k \text{CONTROL}_{it}^k + u_{ist}
$$

== Foreign firms are better in most respects ==
\regressiontable{cross_section}

== Positive selection on exports, negative on TFP ==
\regressiontable{selection}

== Hiring an expat is associated with productivity and exporting ==
\regressiontable{diffindiff}

== Expats help start exporting, but have no effect on continuation ==
\regressiontable{exporter}

= Interpretation =
== Interpretation ==
Three alternative explanations

1. Firm-specific skills
	- no substantial heterogeneity with initial firm characteristics other than exporting
2. General skills
	- labor productivity improvement has persistent effect
3. Reorganization
	- effects of domestic change in management much smaller

== Costs ==
Why does not every firm hire a foreign manager?

1. Wages are higher 
2. Search costs are higher
3. Match is less than perfect



= Conclusions =
== Conclusions ==
- Firms with expat managers improve output per worker and enter export markets.
- Patterns are consistent with a transferable skill interpretation:
	- persistent reorganization
	- technology transfer

== Next steps ==
- Improve identification with matching.
- Explore complementarities of expat managers.
- Explore management team and succession in expat firms.
- Link to World Management Survey: how do management practices of expats differ?
