%% == Foreign owned firms perform better than domestic firms ==
%% * US: Doms and Jensen (1998)
%% * UK: Griffith (1999)
%% * Hungary, Romania, Russia, Ukraine: Brown, Earle, Telegdy (2006)
%% * Indonesia: Arnold and Javorcik (2009)
%% 
%% == Managers matter ==
%% * Good management practices  increase  productivity  (Bloom  and  Van  Reenen  2010;  Bloom  et  al.  2012;  Bloom  et  al.  2014) and market access (Bloom et al. 2016). 
%% * CEOs behaving like ``leaders" gradually improve firm performance. (Bandiera, Hansen, Prat and Sadun 2018)
%% * Large increase  in  the  level  and  inequality  of  CEO  pay.  (Murphy  and  Zábojník  2004;  Gabaix  and  Landier  2008;  Tervio  2008; Frydman and Saks 2010)
%% * Managers have persistent effects across firms on investment policy, R\&D, advertising, return on assets.  (Bertrand and Schoar 2003)
%% * Sudden CEO death worsens firm performance. (Bennedsen, Pérez-González and Wolfenzon 2007) 
%% * Managers having past export experience increase likelihood of exporting (Mion and Opromolla 2014; Mion, Opromolla and Sforza 2016) and importing (Bisztray, Koren and Szeidl 2018).


== This paper ==
* Compile new data on which firm is run by which manager: Hungary, 1980--2018. 
* Measure different degrees of foreign control:
	1. acquisition
	2. replace CEO
	3. hire expat CEO
* Results:
	* Exporters and low-productivity firms become more tightly controlled. 
	* Firms with high immaterial capital receive local managers.
	* Foreign controlled firms become more productive and more likely to export. 


= Data =

== Data ==
=== Hungarian Manager Database ===
* coverage: universe of corporations, 1980--2018
* CEO: highest officer of corporation as specified in corporate law.
	- information: name, mother's name, address, tenure at firm
* 1 million firms, 2 million CEOs, 5 million job spells

=== Balance sheet data ===
* coverage: universe of double entry firms, 1980--2018
* information: sales, exports, employment, equipment, immaterials etc.

== Names ==
* We use manager names to infer 
	1. CEO change
	2. nationality
	3. gender (not used today)
* Foreign manager: firm representative with a non-Hungarian first name
	- e.g. Eva Bauer v Bauer Éva
	- but: George Soros v Soros György
* Allow for misspelling, omitted middle name, missing data (jr, dr)

== Sample ==
* Exclude: 
	- employing less than 20 people
	- financial sector
	- domestic firms with expat CEO
	- greenfield FDI
	- firms with more than 15 CEOs
* Left with 24,500 firms

Sample: $\text{CONTROL}_{i}^{k-1} = 1$, years before acquisition
$$

= Conclusions =
== Conclusions ==
* What are the boundaries of global firms? Past work has studied the causes and consequences of foreign acquisitions. 
* We go one step deeper and ask when are managers also replaced. This arguably increases control over the acquired company. 
* Using data on the universe of foreign acquisitions in Hungary, 1980-2018, we estimate that exporters and low-productivity firms become more tightly controlled. 
* Foreign controlled firms become more productive and more likely to export. 
* These facts help inform theories about the boundaries of global firms and about the role of managers in firm performance.

== Next steps ==
* Collect data on parent firms.
* Build an incomplete-contract model.
