# Motivation
## The end of a Qatari project in Budapest

## The end of a Qatari project in Budapest
* Qatari real estate investors made several high-value investments in Budapest in 2015 (Brückner 2021).
* For them, however, the projects were small, not worth delegating an expatriate manager.
* Business deals, even simple decisions often took months.
* Finally, they sold their stake in December 2020.

## Research question
* What role do expatriate managers play in foreign direct investment?


# Data
## Data
* Administrative data on *all* Hungarian corporations, 1992--2018.
* Financial data, trade transactions (1992--2003)

## Largest investment partners of Hungary 1992--2003

## Large and permanent effects on exports

## And on imports

# Discussion 

## Three stories
### Vertical integration 
Foreign owner takes over firm to export/import within own supply chain.

### Professional network
Managers help connect different firms within their professional network.

### Business culture

## Why managers matter
Three broader implications:

1. Trade within "supply chains" larger than previously thought.
2. Entry into new trade markets is inelastic.
3. Experience with existing partners leads to preferential attachment.

## Business network trade
* Contrary to evidence from US, investment in Hungary leads to large increases in trade with home region.

## Inelastic market entry 
* If professional networks are hard to build, extensive margin of trade is less responsive.
* Competitiveness leads to higher manager wages, not more entry.
* Complementarity of trade and migration policies.

## Preferential attachment 
* It may be easier to trade with friends of friends.
* We (will) highlight a mechanism for why that is.

# Conclusions 
## Conclusions 
* We find firm-level evidence that the nationality and ethnicity of owners and managers matters for the direction of trade.
* Whatever the specific mechanism, we need to model markets and individuals jointly.
