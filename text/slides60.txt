Why and how do firms produce abroad?

1. What are the boundaries of (global) firms?
2. Foreign owned firms perform better than domestic firms
3. Managers matter

%% == Foreign owned firms perform better than domestic firms ==
%% * US: Doms and Jensen (1998)
%% * UK: Griffith (1999)
%% * Hungary, Romania, Russia, Ukraine: Brown, Earle, Telegdy (2006)
%% * Indonesia: Arnold and Javorcik (2009)
%% 
%% == Managers matter ==
%% * Good management practices  increase  productivity  (Bloom  and  Van  Reenen  2010;  Bloom  et  al.  2012;  Bloom  et  al.  2014) and market access (Bloom et al. 2016). 
%% * CEOs behaving like ``leaders" gradually improve firm performance. (Bandiera, Hansen, Prat and Sadun 2018)
%% * Large increase  in  the  level  and  inequality  of  CEO  pay.  (Murphy  and  Zábojník  2004;  Gabaix  and  Landier  2008;  Tervio  2008; Frydman and Saks 2010)
%% * Managers have persistent effects across firms on investment policy, R\&D, advertising, return on assets.  (Bertrand and Schoar 2003)
%% * Sudden CEO death worsens firm performance. (Bennedsen, Pérez-González and Wolfenzon 2007) 
%% * Managers having past export experience increase likelihood of exporting (Mion and Opromolla 2014; Mion, Opromolla and Sforza 2016) and importing (Bisztray, Koren and Szeidl 2018).


== This paper ==
* Compile new data on which firm is run by which manager: Hungary, 1980--2018. 
* Measure different degrees of foreign control:
    1. acquisition
    2. replace CEO
    3. hire expat CEO
* Results:
    * Exporters and low-productivity firms become more tightly controlled. 
    * Firms with high immaterial capital receive local managers.
    * Foreign controlled firms become more productive and more likely to export. 

== Outline (for self) ==
9. Explain name based design 
10. Language 
11. Explain placebo
12. Placebo
13. Do these separately for products?
14. Give magnitudes 
15. Why matters 

= Data =

== Data ==
=== Hungarian Manager Database ===
* coverage: universe of corporations, 1980--2018
* CEO: highest officer of corporation as specified in corporate law.
    - information: name, mother's name, address, tenure at firm
* 1 million firms, 2 million CEOs, 5 million job spells

=== Balance sheet data ===
* coverage: universe of double entry firms, 1980--2018
* information: sales, exports, employment, equipment, immaterials etc.

=== Customs statistics ===
* coverage: universe of direct exports and imports, 1992--2003
* information: product code, partner country, firm id, value


== Names ==
* We use manager names to infer 
    1. CEO change
    2. nationality
    3. gender (not used today)
* Foreign manager: firm representative with a non-Hungarian first name
    - e.g. Eva Bauer v Bauer Éva
    - but: George Soros v Soros György
* Allow for misspelling, omitted middle name, missing data (jr, dr)

== Sample ==
- Exclude: 
    - employing less than 20 people
    - financial sector
    - domestic firms with expat CEO
    - firms with more than 15 CEOs
- Left with ?? firms

== Shape of data ==

123456,Greta,DE,2000-01-01,2003-03-31}

== Data cleaning ==
1. Convert names to numerical IDs
    - normalization
    - Levenshtein distance of name components
    - stricter matching across firms (not used today)
    - more liberal matching within firm
2. Infer Hungarian nationality from name
    - given name in closed list of admissible Hungarian names
3. Classify everyone else as foreign
    - remove firms
    - but: weird typos with limited supporting information
4. Clean up time interval and position description
5. Create annual panel for June 21

== Two stories ==

=== Vertical integration ===
Foreign owner takes over firm to export/import within own business network.

=== Business network ===
Managers help connect different firms within their business network.

== Two stories ==
- They are not exclusive. (Vertical integration is an extreme form of business network.)
- There is (indirect) evidence for both.

= Conclusions =
== Conclusions ==
* What are the causes and consequences of foreign acquisitions?
* We ask when managers are also replaced.
* Using data on the universe of foreign acquisitions in Hungary, 1980-2018, we estimate that exporters and low-productivity firms become more tightly controlled. 
* Foreign controlled firms become more productive and more likely to export. 
* These facts help inform theories about the boundaries of global firms and about the role of managers in firm performance.

== Next steps ==
* Collect data on parent firms.
* Build an incomplete-contract model.
