= Motivation =
== Motivation ==
1. What are the firm-level barriers to trade? Given the large estimated benefits of exporting and importing, fixed costs must be large.
2. Two sets of evidence suggest large role for personal connections.
    * Immigrant networks are key determinants of ''regional'' trade patterns (Rauch 1999...)
    * Face-to-face links facilitate formation of buyer-supplier links (Bernard, Moxnes and Saito 2019, Cai and Szeidl 2018...)

== This paper ==
* Compile new data on which firm is run by which manager: Hungary, 1980--2018. 
    * owner address (country)
    * manager address (country)
    * manager ethnicity 
* Provide firm-market-level evidence on how trade patterns change after foreign acquisition and change of management.
* Results:
    * Country, language and ethnicity of manager strongly predict starting to export/import.
    * Magnitudes defy "easy" explanations.
    * Evidence consistent with a "professional network" effect.

3. Speculations

= Data =

== Data ==
=== Hungarian Manager Database ===
* coverage: universe of corporations, 1980--2018
* CEO: highest officer of corporation as specified in corporate law.
    - information: name, mother's name, address, tenure at firm
* 1 million firms, 2 million CEOs, 5 million job spells

=== Balance sheet data ===
* coverage: universe of double entry firms, 1980--2018
* information: sales, exports, employment, equipment, immaterials etc.

=== Customs statistics ===
* coverage: universe of direct exports and imports, 1992--2003
* information: product code, partner country, firm id, value


== Names ==
* We use manager names to infer 
    1. CEO change
    2. ethnicity
    3. gender (not used today)
* Foreign manager: firm representative with a non-Hungarian first name
    1. e.g. Eva Bauer v Bauer Éva
    2. but: George Soros v Soros György
* Allow for misspelling, omitted middle name, missing data (jr, dr)

== Data cleaning ==
1. Convert names to numerical IDs
2. Infer Hungarian ethnicity from name
3. Classify everyone else as foreign
4. Clean up time interval and position description
5. Create annual panel for June 21
6. In progress: Infer ethnicity (other than Hungarian) from name

== Market entry hazard regressions ==
For each firm-year, take 24 major partner countries. What is the hazard of starting to export/import to/from that country?

$$
\Pr(X_{ict}=1|X_{ict-1}=0) = 
\alpha_{ic} + \mu_{ct} + \nu_{it}

- country-time FE: business conditions in market
- firm-year FE: reorganization, any firm-wide change

== Partner countries ==
Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Finland, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, Ukraine, US

== Effects persist after owner/manager leaves ==
\regressiontable{dynamics}

== Effects are large ==
=== Fixed costs ==
Relative to fixed-cost estimates in Halpern, Koren and Szeidl (2015), effects are equivalent to \$12-14,000 drop in fixed costs ''per year''.

\begin{tabular}{l|cc}
Scenario & Import hazard & Fixed cost \\
\hline
Average firm & 0.010 & \$15,000\\
Only owner & 0.081 & \$2,300\\
Only manager & 0.106 & \$1,700\\
Both & 0.226 & \$600
\end{tabular}

=== Trade experience premia ===
Mion, Opromolla and Sforza (2016) estimate a 0.01--0.04 increase in hazard after manager with relevant export experience joins. Bisztray, Koren and Szeidl (2018) estimiate 0.002--0.005 peer effects in importing.

== Two stories ==

=== Vertical integration ===
Foreign owner takes over firm to export/import within own supply chain.

=== Professional network ===
Managers help connect different firms within their professional network.

== Two stories ==
* They are not exclusive. 
* There is (indirect) evidence for both.
    * Common: more trade with countries expected to be in supply chain / professional network.
    * Distinct: ethnicity matters in addition to address.

== Firms start trading with the \emph{gravity partners} of their owner/manager ==

== Inferring ethnicity from name ==

=== Assumption ===
Conditional on address, ethnicity only correlated with professional network.

== Ethnicity of manager matters \emph{in addition} to her country ==
\regressiontable{language}

== Placebo design ==
- Some owner-manager county pairs arrive more frequently together. E.g., DE-AT, US-DE, US-GB.

=== Placebo for manager network ===
Do these countries receive more trade ''even in absence of manager''?

=== Placebo for vertical integration ===
Do managers matter when firm is ''privately owned''?

== Owner has an effect in \emph{typical manager countries}, but actual managers matter more ==
\regressiontable{placebo}

= Discussion =
== Why managers matter ==
Three broader implications:
1. Trade within "supply chains" larger than previously thought.
2. Entry into new trade markets is inelastic.
3. Experience with existing partners leads to preferential attachment.

== Business network trade ==
* Contrary to evidence from US, investment in Hungary leads to large increases in trade with home region.

== Inelastic market entry ==
* If professional networks are hard to build, extensive margin of trade is less responsive.
* Competitiveness leads to higher manager wages, not more entry.
* Complementarity of trade and migration policies.

== Preferential attachment ==
* It may be easier to trade with friends of friends.
* We (will) highlight a mechanism for why that is.

= Conclusions =
== Conclusions ==
* We find firm-level evidence that the nationality and ethnicity of owners and managers matters for the direction of trade.
* Whatever the specific mechanism, we need to model markets and individuals jointly.

== Next steps ==
* Collect data on parent firms.
* Explore personal network of managers.
* Match similar data for Germany.
