# Motivation


## What are the boundaries of global firms?

\begin{tikzpicture}
\node (a) at (0,0) {arm's length};
\node (b) at (1,0) {relational};
\node (c) at (2,0) {acquisition};
\node (d) at (3,0) {management};
\graph { (a) -> (b) -> (c) -> (d)};
\end{tikzpicture}

## Foreign owned firms perform better than domestic firms 
- US: Doms and Jensen (1998)
- UK: Griffith (1999)
- Hungary, Romania, Russia, Ukraine: Brown, Earle, Telegdy (2006)
- Indonesia: Arnold and Javorcik (2009)

## Managers matter
- Good management practices  increase  productivity  (Bloom  and  Van  Reenen  2010;  Bloom  et  al.  2012;  Bloom  et  al.  2014) and market access (Bloom et al. 2016). 
- CEOs behaving like "leaders" gradually improve firm performance. (Bandiera, Hansen, Prat and Sadun 2018)
- Large increase  in  the  level  and  inequality  of  CEO  pay.  (Murphy  and  Zábojník  2004;  Gabaix  and  Landier  2008;  Tervio  2008; Frydman and Saks 2010)
- Managers have persistent effects across firms on investment policy, R\&D, advertising, return on assets.  (Bertrand and Schoar 2003)
- Sudden CEO death worsens firm performance. (Bennedsen, Pérez-González and Wolfenzon 2007) 
- Managers having past export experience increase likelihood of exporting (Mion and Opromolla 2014; Mion, Opromolla and Sforza 2016) and importing (Bisztray, Koren and Szeidl 2018).



## This paper
- Compile new, unique data on which firm is run by expat manager: Hungary, 1980--2016. 
- Foreign owners improve firm performance by improving management.
- Research design: 
    - differences-in-differences comparing expat-managed firms to domestic managed firms before and after takeover
    - controlling for domestic change in management
