                 proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) and other forms
                 of worker-replacing technological progress. This paper
                 provides a taxonomy of the associated economic issues: First,
                 we discuss the general conditions under which new technologies
                 such as AI may lead to a Pareto improvement. Secondly, we
                 delineate the two main channels through which inequality is
                 affected -- the surplus arising to innovators and
                 redistributions arising from factor price changes. Third, we
                 provide several simple economic models to describe how policy
                 can counter these effects, even in the case of a
                 ``singularity'' where machines come to dominate human labor.
                 Under plausible conditions, non-distortionary taxation can be
                 levied to compensate those who otherwise might lose. Fourth,
                 we describe the two main channels through which technological
                 progress may lead to technological unemployment -- via
                 efficiency wage effects and as a transitional phenomenon.
                 Lastly, we speculate on how technologies to create super-human
                 levels of intelligence may affect inequality and on how to
                 save humanity from the Malthusian destiny that may ensue.",

               Paper addresses this question by defining the appropriate
               counterfactual: what would have happened to investing firms if
               they had not invested abroad. It applies propensity score

               from a sample of national firms which have never invested
               abroad. For a sample of Italian firms, it finds that investments

              vertical spillovers from FDI. Investors' origin may matter for
              spillovers to domestic producers supplying intermediate inputs in
              two ways. First, the share of intermediates sourced locally by
              multinationals is likely to increase with the distance between
              the host and the source economy. Second, the sourcing pattern is
              likely to be affected by preferential trade agreements. In this
              case, the Association Agreement between Romania and the European
              Union (EU) implies that inputs sourced from the EU are subject to
              a lower tariff than inputs sourced from the United States or
              Canada. This means that on average American investors may have a
              greater incentive than EU investors to source from Romania and

              significant relationship in the case of European affiliates. The

               underlying causes of this negative relationship are less well
               understood. This paper exploits a temporary shock to distance,
               the closing of the Suez canal in 1967 and its reopening in 1975,
               to examine the effect of distance on trade and the effect of
               trade on income. Time series variation in sea distance allows
               for the inclusion of pair effects which account for static
               differences in tastes and culture between countries. The
               distance effects estimated in this paper are therefore more
               clearly about transportation costs in the trade of goods than
               typical gravity model estimates. Distance is found to have a
               significant impact on trade with an elasticity that is about
               half as large as estimates from typical cross sectional
               estimates. Since the shock to trade is exogenous for most
               countries, predicted trade volume from the shock can be used to
               identify the effect of trade on income. Trade is found to have a
               significant impact on income. The time series dimension allows
               for country fixed effects which control for all long run income
               differences. Because identification is through changes in sea
               distance, the effect is coming entirely through trade in goods
               and not through alternative channels such as technology

                 increasing in the productivity of the firm a worker is matched
                 with. This feature of the data is predicted by theoretical
                 models of labor market sorting (Shimer and Smith, 2000;
                 Eeckhout and Kircher, 2011), but is at odds with two-way
                 fixed-effect models (Abowd et al., 1999), the most common

  abstract  = "Better managers and managerial practices lead to better firm
               performance. Yet, little is known about what happens when
               managers move across firms. Does a firm hiring a good manager
               improve its performance? If yes is there some valuable knowledge
               the manager has acquired and successfully diffused to the new
               firm? In order to answer these questions we use information
               related to specific activities the manager was involved in when
               working for previous firms. More specifically, we use
               information on whether the manager has worked in the past for
               firms exporting to a specific destination country or a specific
               product. Our data is rich enough to allow controlling for both
               manager and firm unobservables and wash out any time-invariant
               ability of the manager as well as overall firm performance. We
               find that the export experience gained by managers in previous
               firms leads their current firm towards higher export
               performance, and commands a sizable wage premium for the
               manager. We use several strategies to deal with endogeneity
               including an exogenous event study: the sudden end of the
               Angolan civil war in 2002. We further refine our analysis by
               looking at different types of managers (general, production,
               financial and sales) and show how specific export experience
               interacts with the degree of product differentiation and/or the
               financial vulnerability of a firm's products as well as with
               rising import competition from China.",

              for the importance of in-person business meetings in
              international trade. Interactions among trade partners entail a
              fixed cost of trade, but at the same time they generate
              relationship capital, which adds bilateral specific value to the

                 with different productivity levels coexist in an industry

                 productivity before making an irreversible investment to enter
                 the industry. Entry into the export market is also costly, but

               Since observable (to economists) variables account for only a
               small fraction of the wage variance in the data, to answer this
               question it is essential to study assortative matching between
               employers and employees based on their unobserved
               characteristics. This paper enables this line of research. We
               show theoretically that all parameters of the classic model of
               sorting based on absolute advantage in Becker (1973) with search
               frictions can be identified using only matched employer-employee
               data on wages and labor market transitions. In particular, these
               data are sufficient to assess whether matching between workers
               and firms is assortative, whether sorting is positive or
               negative, and to measure the potential effect on output from
               moving any given worker to any given employer in the economy. We

               Country pairs with relatively short air routes compared to sea
               routes benefit more from this change in technology. This

               While the economics literature usually focuses on direct ethnic
               links between source and host countries, sociological studies
               adopt a broader perspective. They emphasize the role of ethnic
               minorities as middlemen who organize trade between various
               regions in the world. Rauch and Trindade [2002] study those

               countries. We revisit their work, particularly focusing on the

               potential ethnic networks. Using new data on bilateral stocks of
               migrants from the World Bank for the year of 2000, we find that

               by other ethnic networks, e. g., the Polish, the Turkish, the
               Mexican, or the Pakistani networks. The large heterogeneity in
               the pro-trade effect of different networks is, among other

  abstract  = "A large literature has shown that geographic frictions reduce
               trade, but has not clarified precisely why. In this paper, we
               provide some insight into why such frictions matter by examining
               what parts of trade these frictions reduce most. Using data that
               track manufacturers' shipments within the US on an exceptionally
               fine grid, we find that the pattern of shipments is extremely
               localized. Shipments within 5-digit zip codes, which have a
               median radius of just 4 miles, are 3 times larger than shipments
               outside the zip code. We decompose aggregate shipments into
               extensive and intensive margins, and show that distance and
               other frictions reduce aggregate trade values primarily by
               reducing the number of commodities shipped and the number of
               establishments shipping. Extensive margins are particularly
               important over very short distances. We examine trade in
               intermediate goods as an explanation for highly localized
               shipments and the dominant role of the extensive margin and find
               evidence consistent with this hypothesis. In another significant
               finding, we find no evidence of state-level home bias when
               distances are measured precisely and trade is observed over a

              manager fixed effects matter for a wide range of corporate
              decisions. A significant extent of the heterogeneity in
              investment, financial, and organizational practices of firms can
              be explained by the presence of manager fixed effects. We
              identify specific patterns in managerial decision-making that
              appear to indicate general differences in ``style'' across
              managers. Moreover, we show that management style is
              significantly related to manager fixed effects in performance and

              dimensions of firm heterogeneity. The first dimension is
              ``process productivity'', which is how we denote the standard
              concept of productivity as modeled in the literature. The second
              one is ``product productivity'', defined as firms' ability to
              develop high-quality products spending small fixed outlays. The
              distinction between these two sources of productivity, together
              with the assumption that iceberg trade costs decrease with
              quality, delivers various conditional exporter premia as
              theoretical predictions. Conditional on size, exporters sell
              higher quality products, charge higher prices, pay higher input
              prices and higher wages, and use capital more intensively. Some
              of these predictions had already been documented in the empirical
              literature but lacked a theoretical framework for properly
              interpreting them. We conduct systematic tests of these

               managers acquire knowledge via a variety of different channels
               which are often difficult to track down and quantify. By
               matching employer--employee data with trade data at the firm
               level we show that the export experience acquired by managers in
               previous firms leads their current firm toward higher export
               performance, and commands a sizeable wage premium for the
               manager. Moreover, export knowledge is decisive when it is
               market-specific: managers with experience related to markets
               served by their current firm receive an even higher wage
               premium; firms are more likely to enter markets where their
               managers have experience; exporters are more likely to stay in
               those markets, and their sales are on average higher. Our

               These changes are constructed using data on employment for small

              only new airline routes that are the outcome of a merger between
              two airlines or the opening of a new hub, and when I consider
