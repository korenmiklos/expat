unable to allocate matrix;
    You have attempted to create a matrix with too many rows or columns or
    attempted to fit a model with too many variables.

    You are using Stata/BE which supports matrices with up to 800 rows or
    columns.  See limits for how many more rows and columns Stata/SE and
    Stata/MP can support.

    If you are using factor variables and included an interaction that has
    lots of missing cells, try set emptycells drop to reduce the required
    matrix size; see help set emptycells.

    If you are using factor variables, you might have accidentally treated a
    continuous variable as a categorical, resulting in lots of categories.
    Use the c. operator on such variables.
